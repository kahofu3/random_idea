## How VWAP Reversion Works

1. **VWAP** = Volume Weighted Average Price (the "fair value")
2. **Strategy Logic**:
   - BUY when price drops 2 standard deviations below VWAP + RSI < 30
   - SELL when price rises 2 standard deviations above VWAP + RSI > 70
3. **Why It Works**: Markets tend to revert to their volume-weighted average
